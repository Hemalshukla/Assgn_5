I began by determining whether the dataset was clean. However, it was tidy. I have the identical column with the name "index" in both datasets. The dataset merge then encounters an issue. Although I tried to merge them with the index column, I kept getting syntax errors. Then, with some assistance from Google, I discovered that we must use the "on=" function to combine two datasets with the same one column. I entered "on = 'index'" at the end to combine two datasets.
