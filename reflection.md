Keeping data clean and accurate was one of the biggest obstacles I faced. 
Data preprocessing required cautious attention and a methodical methodology to deal with duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.
This stage emphasised the value of data preparation as the starting point for precise analysis.

Another significant difficulty was in creating and putting the JOIN and aggregate processes into practise. 
Despite the fact that these procedures are fundamental, I found that precise attribute selection for JOIN and the right aggregation measures necessitate a thorough grasp of the data and its context. 
This realisation highlighted the significance of in-depth data research and subject expertise in creating efficient conversions.

As I think back on this project, I see some elements that I would handle differently in the future. 
First of all, I would set aside more time.
